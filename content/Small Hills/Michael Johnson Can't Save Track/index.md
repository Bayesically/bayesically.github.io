I've called this series of posts "Small Hills" because these are piddling things that very few people care about, but they are strong opinions I hold and represent "small hills I'm willing to die on". Super niche items which I have unusually strong opinions on, and I will hold to my opinion until the day I die (yes, this is dumb).

## Track and Field isn't Football

I really like watching professional track and field, and moreso professional road racing.

Let's all admit - liking track and field is pretty weird in the first place. Every four years at the Olympics, the 100m final is brilliant and everyone wants to know who's the fastest man/woman in the world. If you're watching obscure indoor season track meets through a sketchy YouTube restream, *you are a weirdo*. Yes, this is me.

It's not football (soccer), it's not basketball, it's not even cricket *(burn)*.

Michael Johnson, 4-time Olympic champion, 8-time World Champion sprinter, thinks that track should have a bigger place on the world sporting stage and the business of athletics should be much bigger. More money = more competition = better stories = more viewers = more money. It's a virtuous cycle.

## 'I can save track - not track and field'

Michael Johnson has led a huge influx of investment into a new athletics league he started called "Grand Slam Track". The idea is you just have 4 events (the "grand slams"), like the Grand Slams in Tennis, with fewer disciplines (largely sprints, hurdles, and some distance running), built around star power and TV storytelling, not stats. The goal, quite fairly, aims to bring in the casual sports fan, not the weirdo like me.

You might notice that the list of events didn't include long jump, high jump, pole vault, anything involving throwing, etc. Hence the title above - Michael Johnson supposes that field events (jumps, throws, etc.) are much more difficult to package to that casual sports fan whose eye you want to catch. ***I completely agree.*** Let's look at this as a purely financial exercise. You get money per viewer-minute. The longer each person watches and the more people who are watching equal your value in the eyes of a broadcaster or sponsor. Advertisers want people looking at their logo on your hoardings or in your adverts during TV breaks. People running really fast is easier to package as exciting than two people doing the best pole vaults in history (Mondo Duplantis is however, my GOAT athlete, but it's harder to sell to an advertiser).

Johnson's thesis is that you need to grab the bits of track and field which have the broadest appeal and interest, and build a storyline around them.

## Just Keep Going Faster

I believe there's a slight hitch here: People love watching things that have never been done before. Everyone tunes in during the Olympics to watch Usain Bolt set the World Record, they're not there to watch the 231st fastest time in history.

Johnson's attempt through this series is to emphasise the racing, how #1 pipped #2 by one thousandth of a second in their fierce rivalry.

The problem with World Records is that they're bloody hard to make happen. You need once-in-a-generation athletes to have a good training block, line up against the right opposition, on the right track (some are bouncier than others), with the right weather (no rain, no crazy temperatures, no wind), and a little sprinkle of magic (or luck). If you're being really cynical you might also say "and they didn't get caught doping".

You have a chance of doing the above once every 4 years at the Olympics. You can't build a sustainable business model around achieving that 4 times a year and drawing eyes on that promise. It just won't happen.

Nobody watches Real Madrid vs Barcelona expecting a "World Record" 21-0 trouncing, they've built a story and a rivalry which people watch as pure entertainment. Johnson is focussed on targeting this kind of story where the first person over the line is the winner. The time doesn't matter.

## First to the Line Wins?

The goal of GST therefore is to play on these stories, with the same athletes competing over 4 events, developing a rivalry and story within.

I think there's a problem with the format they settled on here. To maximise star power in races, they paired up distances (e.g. "Short Sprints - 100m and 200m") where athletes from both events ran head-to-head at both distances. Their positions are then combined and there's a (simple) point system to identify a winner. My objection here is *but now the first person to the line doesn't win!* This is a difficult trade-off between maximising star power and competitive understanding for the audience, but you can watch a race and *not know who won*. Plus, those events are often on consecutive days - I wouldn't want to race an 800m and a 1500m on the same day either, I get it - but you have to remember what happened *the previous day* to know who actually won overall. ***This is really confusing and a bad format.***

## Money, Money, Money

GST has drawn a good amount of money into track - athletes are treated really well and prize pots are huge in track terms ($100k for the winner). All the "other money" in addition to prizes like athlete appearance fees, bonuses, flights, accommodation etc. aren't public, but for the 4 events GST planned, they probably spent more than the combined athlete purse for 15 events of a Diamond League season, GST's competitor.

I suppose the elephant in the room here is the fact that GST's burn rate is clearly huge - the fourth and final event of the GST season was cancelled. While this wasn't announced as financially motivated, it's quite hard not to see it as a tightening of the belt. This might be because of spending, but the number of empty seats in their events so far can't have helped the finances. Looking at the video of GST-Kingston, you'd be lucky to have sold 10% of the seats.

It's hard not to compare what the millions of dollars that GST invested into their events could have done if spent on the Diamond League, but this is a pointless argument. Those investors clearly aren't interested in spending on the existing Diamond League structure, so GST is effectively funded by "free" money. What is certain is that if GST fails, that money won't be there next year.

## So What's the Point?

Hah, you assumed I had one. I think that GST is an interesting exercise in trying to make an obscure sport into a popular sport. I also think it's largely failed to turn a once-in-4-years sport into a regular-watching sport. My main point is that maybe track (and field) will never be as popular as football, and maybe the business model should be based around supporting a secondary sport, not a blockbuster sport?

It was also based around being about to say *"Michael Johnson Can't Save Track"*. Damn, do I admire him trying, though.

### üèî Small Hill Summary:  
Track is weird, GST is weirder, but at least it's trying. Field events are unsellable. Let‚Äôs not pretend track is football.
