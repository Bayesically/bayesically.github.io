Sometimes, random chance pulls a set of circumstances and fate aligns them into a beautiful coincidence.

So it was when the *Sveriges herrlandslag i fotboll* played the *Danmarks herre-fodboldlandshold.* Without being enigmatic, the Swedish national football team played Denmark's national football team. The scoreboard gloriously read: ![[Pasted image 20250616191435.png]]
## Level 1 (Nerd)

Now if you're a loser like me, you think "huh, are there more combinations of this which might work?".

Sweden vs Denmark -> SWE-DEN

How about we get a big list of all the three-letter country codes in use by FIFA and brute force check them all?

Anyway here are the other options:
Cyprus vs Russia -> CYP-RUS
Poland vs Andorra -> POL-AND
Bhutan vs Tanzania -> BHU-TAN

## Level 2 (Data Goblin)

Then obviously, the next stage is to ask "well, have these games also happened?". So you download a database of international football games and do some counts:

| Scoreline | Match Count |
| --------- | ----------- |
| SWE-DEN   | 54          |
| CYP-RUS   | 6           |
| POL-AND   | 2           |
| BHU-TAN   | 0           |
Well if this isn't a call to action, I don't know what is! Bhutan and Tanzania have *never* played each other?

## Level 3 (Logistical Nightmare)

So obviously the campaign to get Tanzania's national team to Bhutan begins today. There is a slight issue in that the journey of ~6,900km seems rather difficult. Google flights couldn't suggest a way to make it happen:![[Pasted image 20250616194503.png]]
I think these are small hurdles, and that Tanzania's football team should consider this a number one priority.
